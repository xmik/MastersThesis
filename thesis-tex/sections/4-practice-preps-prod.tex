\section{Preparations for production deployment of a Kubernetes cluster}
\label{prep-prod}
\textit{This is a practical section. It includes planning and designing the production deployment, considering: capacity planning, choosing which requirements to satisfy and taking any other deployment and infrastructure related decisions. No AWS resources were created here, but AWS CLI was used to get some information.}
~\\

\subsection{AWS Region}
\textit{The first decision to take is to choose the AWS Region in which all the resources should be deployed.}
\\

The Kubernetes cluster deployment constitutes the empirical work of this study. The deployment will target the AWS cloud. This cloud provides many data centers, spread across multiple physical locations around the world. AWS calls these locations: Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones. AWS offers many resources (for example: S3, EC2 or EKS). Some of them are global, whereas the others are tied to a Region, an Availability Zone, or a Local Zone\cite{az}.

While it matters not which Availability Zone will be chosen, \textbf{choosing a Region has some consequences}. For example, AMIs are tied to a Region. AMIs may be copied between Regions. It may happen, that some officially supported AMIs are available only in a limited number of Regions and choosing some other Region would incur more \textbf{time and money} needed to copy the image. There is a charge for data transfer between Regions\cite{az}.

AWS Local Zones are a new type of AWS infrastructure deployment. Thanks to them, AWS resources can be put closer to large population, industry, and IT centers where no AWS Region exists today. AWS Local Zones help to run latency sensitive applications closer to end users. Even single-digit millisecond latency can be achieved. The use cases for such latency are for example: media & entertainment content creation, real-time gaming, reservoir simulations, electronic design automation, and machine learning\cite{lz}. AWS Local Zones are available since 9th March 2020 and there is currently one AWS Local Zone, available in Los Angeles, California\cite{lz-blog}. For this work, single-digit millisecond latency is not needed.

In this work, AWS EC2 instances will be used (Elastic Compute Cloud resources). The following AWS CLI command was run to list all the available regions for the AWS account of the author of this work:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small,caption={A command of AWS CLI tool used to list all the available regions (for an AWS account)},captionpos=b,language=Bash,xleftmargin=1cm]
$ aws ec2 describe-regions
\end{lstlisting}

The returned list of Regions was: "eu-north-1", "eu-west-3", "eu-west-2", "eu-west-1", "eu-central-1", "ap-south-1", "ap-northeast-2", "ap-northeast-1", "sa-east-1", "ca-central-1", "ap-southeast-1", "ap-southeast-2", "us-east-1", "us-east-2", "us-west-1", "us-west-2". Considering the geographical proximity, the Region should be in Europe. The Regions' names are mapped to geographical locations below (limited to Europe)\cite{aws-region-map}:
\begin{itemize}
\item "eu-north-1" - Europe (Stockholm)
\item "eu-west-1" - Europe (Ireland)
\item "eu-west-2" - Europe (London)
\item "eu-west-3" - Europe (Paris)
\item "eu-central-1" - Europe (Frankfurt)
\item "eu-south-1" - Europe (Milan)
\end{itemize}

The next criterion of choosing the Region is \textbf{price}. The pricing for EC2 instances were compared for 5 AWS Regions (available for a particular AWS account, in Europe). A few EC2 instance types were considered, but from the General Purpose family of types. Only Linux/UNIX usage was taken into consideration. The comparison is presented in the table below. The data comes from the official AWS EC2 pricing website\cite{ec2-pricing}. The prices are noted \textbf{in USD per hour of an EC2 instance running}.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}


Thus, basing on the three factors (Region being available for an AWS account, in Europe and the cheapest) - \textbf{the Region chosen is: Europe (Ireland) - "eu-west-1"}. Then, the next thing to decide upon was choosing availability zones. All the AZs available in the chosen region can be listed with the following command\cite{online-kops-aws}:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small,caption={A command of AWS CLI tool used to list all the available AZs in the chosen AWS Region)},captionpos=b,language=Bash,xleftmargin=1cm]
$ aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region eu-west-1
\end{lstlisting}
The command output listed the following AZs: "eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c".

\subsection{Version of Kubernetes}
\textit{In this section, it is decided which Kubernetes version to use.}
\\

\subsubsection{Why it is important to choose a particular version}
In order to compare two methods of Kubernetes deployment in a reasonable way, \textbf{both methods should deploy the same Kubernetes version}. Also, the version should be one of the latest released ones, for the sake of keeping this comparison up-to-date. Furthermore, using a specified version is important for the production environment, because:
\begin{itemize}
\item the environment should be easy to recreate,
\item the experiment (the empirical work of this study: deploying a Kubernetes cluster) should be possible to be repeated,
\item using specified versions helps to incorporate Infrastructure as Code and DevOps best practices and to automate the deployments.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Which version was chosen}
At the time of writing this work, \textbf{in May 2020}, the latest released versions of the needed software are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Kubernetes version 1.18\cite{online-k8s-blog-latest},
\item Kops version 1.16.2, Kubernetes versions supported by Kops are: 1.16.9, 1.15.11, 1.14.10, 1.13.12, 1.12.10\cite{online-kops-versions}\cite{kops-releases}\cite{online-kops-versions2},
\item Kubernetes versions supported by EKS: 1.16.8, 1.15.11, 1.14.9, 1.13.12. However, Kubernetes version 1.13 is deprecated\cite{online-eks-versions}. There are also particular EKS Platform versions for each supported Kubernetes version. For example, for Kubernetes 1.16.8 there is one EKS Platform version: eks.1\cite{online-eks-platform-versions}.
\item Eksctl version 0.20.0\cite{online-eksctl-versions}
\end{itemize}

EKS documentation recommends that unless a specific Kubernetes version is required, the latest supported version should be chosen\cite{online-eks-versions}. Basing on the above information, \textbf{the maximum version of Kubernetes, supported by the two deployment methods, was: v1.16.8}. However, one has to consider the AWS AMIs with Kubernetes installed. There are some EKS-optimized Linux AMIs - built for this exact purpose - to be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. They are built on top of \textbf{Amazon Linux 2}\cite{eks-optimized-ami}. Besides the official Amazon EKS-optimized AMIs, Canonical (the commercial support provider for Ubuntu) has partnered with Amazon EKS to create worker node AMIs built on top of \textbf{Ubuntu}\cite{eks-ubu}. Judging from the official Canonical website, which provides the EKS Ubuntu AMIs IDs, the latest supported Kubernetes version is 1.15. There is an AMI available for the chosen AWS Region "eu-west-1" and the AMI's ID is: ami-0ceab0713d94f9276\cite{eks-ubu-ami-id}.

Amazon Linux 2 is a Linux Server Operating System, provided by Amazon. Among the features it provides are: optimized performance (to help ease integration with AWS Services), long term support, bleeding edge software updates support, on-premises use, systemd support, etc.\cite{al2}. However, Amazon Linux 2 is a RPM-based Linux distribution (which can be judged based on information that many applications developed on CentOS (and similar distributions) run on Amazon Linux)\cite{al2-centos}. RPM-based Linux distributions include: CentOS, Fedora, Red Hat Linux, etc. Since the author of this work has little experience with RPM-based Linux distributions, \textbf{the AWS EKS AMIs with Ubuntu were preferred}. This decision should not impact the aim of this work but it should result in less time spent on troubleshooting.

Considering all the information presented in this section, the \textbf{version of Kubernetes chosen was: 1.15.11}.



\subsection{Tools and development environment}
\label{tools}
\textit{This section can be treated as a checklist of what tools should be gathered before deploying a Kubernetes cluster. It also characterizes a development environment.}
\\

Let's start with a list of essential tools needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux
\item bash
\item kubectl
\item aws cli 2
\item eksctl
\item kops
\item helm
\item bats-core
\end{itemize}

Now, each of these tools will be briefly introduced. TODO

When it comes to \textbf{development environment} - the Ubuntu 18.04 workstation was used. In order to facilitate repetition of the empirical work of this study, all the deployment was performed from a Docker container. Thus, the local development environment was just obliged to: have Docker installed, Internet access and AWS credentials configured. The Docker container used, was created from a Docker image: TODO, ... Dojo, Dojofile contents, , dojo out of scope of this work, how the container was run, etc... Thanks to such a solution, it should be easy to run the deployment from a local workstation (e.g. from a local laptop) and also from a CI server.

TODOooo


\subsection{Selected requirements of a production deployment and acceptance criteria needed to satisfy them}
\textit{Here a set of production deployment requirements is presented. Each of them is shortly described. Acceptance criteria, needed to satisfy the requirements are provided. This section helps to plan the deployment.}
\\

\textbf{There are numerous requirements for a production deployment of a Kubernetes cluster}. Some of them were gathered throughout the available literature and presented in the section: \ref{Production deployment requirements}. It is common knowledge that companies, which deploy Kubernetes and similar systems, obey some set of best practices, dedicated to these companies only. Thus, the requirements presented in this work do not exhaust the topic.

Below, there is a list of the selected production deployment requirements. In the empirical part of this study, the requirements were  attempted to be satisfied.
\begin{itemize}
\item A healthy cluster
\item Automated operations
\item Central Logging
\item Central Monitoring
\item Central Audit
\item Backup
\item High Availability
\item Autoscaling
\item Security
\item Live Cluster Upgrades
\end{itemize}

The set entails \textbf{10 requirements}. Each of them was already described theoretically, but further in this chapter, each requirement is explained from a practical point of view. The \textbf{acceptance criteria} needed to satisfy each of the requirements are presented. Basing on this, a plan of a Kubernetes cluster deployment is created. The work done is described in the next chapter, together with any problems encountered and troubleshooting sessions.

\subsubsection{A healthy and usable cluster}
\label{A healthy cluster}

% health checks
Unless any of the Kubernetes control plane components is healthy, it will need to be fixed. It should not be a problem with a managed Kubernetes services, but for self hosted clusters, this should be checked. It should be noted that, since the \textbf{health checks} ought to be run frequently, they shouldn't do anything too expensive. To monitor the health of a Kubernetes cluster, \textbf{the following could be checked: number of nodes, node health status, number of pods per node and overall, resource usage/allocation per node, and overall}\cite{book-cndwk}.

% api endpoint reachable under a domain name
When all the cluster health checks are passed, then the cluster is healthy. But, the cluster should be also usable for end users. End users will want to deploy applications on top of the cluster. Thus, they have to have the possibility to reach the cluster endpoint, which in practice means, that they have to \textbf{be able to reach the Kubernetes API Server endpoint}. Such an endpoint may be an IP address or a domain name. Since the cluster will be deployed in a production environment, a domain name is preferred. Furthermore, many sources claim that a top-level domain or a subdomain is required to create a Kubernetes cluster with Kops. Alternatively, gossip-based DNS can be used instead, and then, the cluster domain name would have to end with \textit{.k8s.local} and the API server would be available under the AWS load balancer address\cite{kops-howto-aws}\cite{online-kops-aws}\cite{kops-howto-k8s}\cite{kops-gossip}.

% test app can be deployed
TODO: deploy some test app and test it

To summarize, in order for a cluster to be healthy and usable, the following acceptance criteria must be met:
\begin{itemize}
\item the cluster should have health checks passed,
\item the Kubernetes API Server endpoint should be reachable for the end users under a domain name,
\item it should be tested that an application can be deployed on top of a Kubernetes cluster.
\end{itemize}

* kubectl get nodes, kubectl version --short,
* deploy some test service and test it; use helm - maybe apache chart + use the idea from https://learnk8s.io/blog/kubernetes-chaos-engineering-lessons-learned to display the hostname of the current pod in a web page (so that we know if many pods are deployed?); kubectl scale then!
* use bats for all the tests
* kops validate cluster


% "Service: A Kubernetes Service that identifies a set of Pods using label selectors. Unless mentioned otherwise, Services are assumed to have virtual IPs only routable within the cluster network." thus we use ingress https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/ ; "Kubernetes Service with type: LoadBalancer -> Each Service spawns its own ELB, incurring extra cost." https://medium.com/@dmaas/amazon-eks-ingress-guide-8ec2ec940a70


\subsubsection{Automated operations}

Setting up a package manager for reusable Kubernetes deployments is recommended\cite{gruntwork-howto-blog}. In this work: Helm is used and it was already described in the section: \rel{tools}.

* Automation and Infrastructure as Code - eksctl YAML config, kops YAML config, cloudformation? terraform?
* tasks file - one command to run one operation
* helm and bats also help automation
* additionally (if there is time): try AWS CI Server (or some other CI Server)
* write again that iac facilitates the repetition of future evalutaions, repeating this experiment

\subsubsection{Central Logging}

* try AWS CloudWatch Logs
* additionally (if there is time): deploy Graylog (or Fluentd or Logstash, etc) on AWS

\subsubsection{Central Monitoring}

* try AWS CloudWatch Alarms and dashboards
* try kubernetes dashboard
* additionally (if there is time): deploy Grafana + influxdb on AWS

\subsubsection{Central Audit}

* try AWS CloudTrail

\subsubsection{Backup}

* backup etcd with the test service deployed and try to restore in a new k8s cluster


\subsubsection{Capacity planning and High Availability}
\textit{Here the needed capacity is discussed. The aim is to have a minimal working cluster that could be representative for a production environment. Number of machines and IT resources (CPU, Memory) is considered.}
\\

The important thing is, that the to-be-deployed Kubernetes cluster, should have the minimal amount of capacity, but still it should be representative for a production environment. Here \textbf{chicken-counting} (0, 1, many) comes to the rescue. Applying the chicken-counting technique means that if a production site has 250 web servers, 2 should be enough to represent it\cite{book-cicd}. Since a Kubernetes cluster consists of a master node and worker nodes, then it was decided that \textbf{a representative cluster would be made of two worker nodes}. When it comes to number of master nodes needed, one is enough for the minimal deployment. But in order to achieve high availability at least two master nodes are needed and they should span multiple AZs\cite{article-aws-architecting}. However, having an odd number is recommended for master nodes to avoid issues with consesus/quorum. Thus, \textbf{at least three master nodes are needed}\cite{online-ha-k8s-blog}.

The capacity of a cluster means the sum of CPU and memory of all the cluster worker nodes. Multiple ways are possible to achieve the desired target capacity. Example given: if a cluster with a total capacity of 8 CPU cores and 32 GB of RAM is needed, then it can be achieved by, for example, having two nodes (each with 4 CPU and 16 GB RAM) or having four nodes (each with 2 CPU and 8 GB RAM)\cite{kubernetes-node-size}. Now there are two questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item it is better to have a few bigger nodes or many smaller nodes?
\item what is the minimal capacity needed for a production cluster?
\end{itemize}

The table below summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of having a few bigger nodes. For more information about the pros and cons presented in the table \ref{tab:pros-cons-large-nodes}, a reader is referred to an online source: "Architecting Kubernetes clusters — choosing a worker node size"\cite{kubernetes-node-size}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{1\textwidth} {
  | >{\centering\arraybackslash}X
  | >{\centering\arraybackslash}X | }
 \hline
  \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages}  \\
 \hline
 Less management overhead (less number of machines to manage)  & Large number of pods per node (each pod introduces some overhead, if there are too many pods, the system may slow down)   \\
 \hline
 Resource-hungry applications allowed  & Large scaling increments  \\
 \hline
  Potential lower costs per node (the price increase for a more powerful may not be linear)  & Limited replication (each replica of a pod may be requested to be deployed on a different node. If a HA application requires 5 replicas, but there are only 2 nodes in a cluster, then the effective degree of replication is reduced to 2)  \\
 \hline
  Large numbers of nodes can be a challenge for the Kubernetes control plane (there are many network communication paths and also also more load on the etcd database) & The impact of one failed node is big   \\
 \hline
  Better resources utilization &   \\
 \hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{\label{tab:pros-cons-large-nodes}Comparison advantages and disadvantages of having a few bigger nodes in a Kubernetes cluster instead of having many smaller nodes\cite{kubernetes-node-size}}
\end{table}

However, in the Internet there are contradictory information about the limited replication. The online source cited above\cite{kubernetes-node-size} states that there can be maximally as many replicas as worker nodes in a cluster, while another source - a blog post\cite{learnk8s-ll} claims that there can be more pod replicas than nodes. This information was not verified in practice in this work. Perhaps the replicas limit depends on Kubernetes version - but this is just a speculation of this work's author.

It is officially claimed, that Kubernetes supports up to 5000 nodes and up to 100 pods per node\cite{kubernetes-node-size}\cite{kubernetes-large}. However, in practice, 500 nodes may already lead to non-trivial challenges. Furthermore, as far as AWS EKS is concerned, there are some hard limits for number of pods allowed for a particular EC2 instance type. For example, for a t2.medium instance, the maximum number of pods is 17, for t2.small it's 11, and for both: t2.micro and t2.nano it's 4\cite{kubernetes-node-size}\cite{eks-hard-limits}.

\textbf{There was no official statement found stating the minimal capacity of a Kubernetes cluster}. Thus, in the empirical part, the work will be started from using the smallest (and cheapest EC2 instance type). Should there be any problems, instance types with more resources will be used. Generally, the EC2 resources type should depend on the total quantity of resources needed by pods. (Some pods will be deployed in order to test whether the cluster is healthy). Some overhead must be also considered, because the amount of compute resources that are available for pods, \textbf{the allocatable}, is smaller than the capacity of the whole node\cite{k8s-alloc}.

To summarize: the production cluster should have at least three master nodes and two worker nodes. The experiments will start from the smallest (and cheapest EC2 instance type) available.

\subsubsection{Autoscaling}

* increase the number of pod replicas, make autoscaling work

\subsubsection{Security}
\textit{Security is handled by applying private networking, AWS Security groups, proper authentication and authorization.}
\\

First, let's handle the networking. In order to have a clear understanding of how the networking will be set up, a few terms have to be explained. \textbf{VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud} and it is an AWS resource, providing the networking services. When a VPC is created, it means that a virtual private network is created and assigned to a particular AWS account. AWS resources can be launched into that VPC. Each VPC has a CIDR block assigned. The VPC cannot span more than one AWS Region. The VPC can be divided into subnetworks (or subnets). One subnet cannot span more than one Availability Zone. \textbf{Subnets can be either public or private}. If a subnet's traffic is routed to an internet gateway (which is an AWS resource), the subnet is known as a public subnet. Otherwise, a subnet is private\cite{aws-vpc}. This means that public subnets have access to the Internet.

In order to stay secure, access to the Kubernetes cluster should be limited. This can be achieved in multiple ways.

%%% aaa

it was decided that in the deployments for this work, \textbf{the private network topology was chosen}. This should be set for both deployment methods.


% private networking

There are \textbf{two network topologies supported by Kops: public and private}. When the public topology is chosen, then all masters and workers of a Kubernetes cluster will be launched in a public subnet in the VPC. Respectively: when using the private topology, all the machines will be launched in a private subnet in the VPC\cite{kops-net-topo}. This is settable as a CLI flag\cite{kops-net}:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small,caption={CLI flag used by kops to set private networking mode},captionpos=b,language=Bash,xleftmargin=1cm]
--topology private
\end{lstlisting}

When using eksctl, this is also possible: the initial nodegroup (worker nodes) can be isolated from the public Internet by the following CLI flag\cite{eksctl-net}:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small,caption={CLI flag used by eksctl to set private networking mode},captionpos=b,language=Bash,xleftmargin=1cm]
--node-private-networking
\end{lstlisting}
or by setting in the YAML configuration file\cite{eks-example}:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small,caption={YAML configuration used by Kops to set private networking mode},captionpos=b,language=Bash,xleftmargin=1cm]
nodeGroups:
  - name: ng-1
    instanceType: m5.xlarge
    desiredCapacity: 2
    privateNetworking: true # if only 'Private' subnets are given, this must be enabled
\end{lstlisting}

% HA NAT Gateway

When the private network topology is chosen, kops creates one NAT Gateway (NGW) per AZ\cite{kops-net2}. Such a \textbf{NGW is then highly available} - which is an important production deployment requirement. There is also a possibility to set it with eksctl with\cite{eksctl-net}:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small,caption={YAML configuration used by eksctl to set NAT Gateway as Highly Available},captionpos=b,language=Bash,xleftmargin=1cm]
vpc:
  nat:
    gateway: HighlyAvailable # other options: Disable, Single (default)
\end{lstlisting}

The NAT Gateway is needed, because the worker nodes must have access to the Internet, in order to function properly. If the worker nodes are deployed in a private subnet, then the private subnet will access the Internet through a NAT Gateway\cite{eks-net}.

% endpoint access

The next thing is to consider \textbf{whether the API Server is accessible from within a VPC only or from the public Internet}. For the production deployment, access from within a VPC only is recommended. \textbf{In order to allow access from a remote computer, through the Internet, a bastion host or a VPN server is needed}\cite{gruntwork-howto}. It is essential to understand that NAT Gateway is needed in order to allow Internet access from an AWS EC2 machine, while bastion host allows to access that machine from outside. The functionality of a bastion host is to provide secure access to Linux instances located in the private and public subnets\cite{aws-bastion}.

When a new EKS cluster is created, Amazon provides an endpoint for the managed Kubernetes API server. Thanks to that, one can communicate with the cluster (for example using a Kubernetes management tool: kubectl). As a default configuration, this API server endpoint is public to the internet, and also access to the API server is secured using a combination of AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) and RBAC (native Kubernetes Role Based Access Control). Private access to the API server can be enabled. Thanks to that all communication between the worker nodes and the API server stays within a VPC\cite{eks-cluster-endpoint}.

When private endpoint is enabled, AWS EKS creates a Route 53 private hosted zone, but this zone does not appear in AWS Route 53 resources. What is essential is that the Route53 resource is assigned to a VPC and such a VPC must have 'enableDnsHostnames' and 'enableDnsSupport' set to 'true', and also the DHCP options set for the VPC must include 'AmazonProvidedDNS' in its domain name servers list. Apart from this, there is also a requirement that an IAM Role or User (used to manage the AWS EKS cluster) must be given 'route53:AssociateVPCWithHostedZone' permissions\cite{eks-cluster-endpoint}.

Enabling private endpoint is settable with eksctl in YAML file\cite{eksctl-net}:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small,caption={YAML configuration used by eksctl to set EKS cluster endpoints},captionpos=b,language=Bash,xleftmargin=1cm]
vpc:
  clusterEndpoints:
    publicAccess:  <true|false>
    privateAccess: <true|false>
\end{lstlisting}
However, if only private access is allowed, then eksctl cannot create the cluster. Thus, at cluster creation, both: public and private access will be enabled. Then, the public access can be disabled\cite{eksctl-net}.

The table below summarizes what configuration must be set when using eksctl and kops to ensure a secure, production ready networking:

\end{table}


There are \textbf{three networking modes supported by Kops: kubenet, cni and external}. Kubenet is the default mode, but it is not recommended for production clusters, because of its limitations. One of the limitations is, that kubenet disallows having more than 50 nodes per cluster. Another limitation is that if a cluster uses the private network topology, then it cannot use kubenet\cite{kops-net}.

In order to stay secure, it was decided that \textbf{the private network topology and the cni networking mode} should be chosen. But, there are many CNI providers supported by Kops, for example: AWS VPC, Calico, Flannel, Weave\cite{kops-net-topo}.

No further steps are needed to enforce this minimum. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-security-enforcing-tls.html#enforcing-tls-v2
 use latest aws cli 2 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-troubleshooting.html

* custom ssh pair? - possible
* eks - custom vpc? custom cni? - this is possible, future work, https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/blob/master/examples/04-existing-vpc.yaml, https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/blob/master/examples/02-custom-vpc-cidr-no-nodes.yaml ; By default, eksctl create cluster will build a dedicated VPC https://eksctl.io/usage/vpc-networking/
* node groups vs managed node groups vs cluster autoscaler?
* custom iam and role?
* eks: version in practice: 1.16.8 for nodes, 1.15 for master, also:
```
$ echo $(eksctl create cluster --version invalid 2>&1) | rev | sed 's/ //g' | cut -d ":" -f-1 | rev
1.12,1.13,1.14,1.15
```https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/issues/2040#issuecomment-614322730
* security - isolate initial nodegroup from the public internet https://eksctl.io/usage/vpc-networking/
* security - iam https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/blob/master/examples/17-permissions-boundary.yaml https://eksctl.io/usage/iam-permissions-boundary/
* security - RBAC
* autoscaleir https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/blob/master/examples/eks-quickstart-app-dev.yaml http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling
* change control plane config - need a custom ami? https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami

2. helm architecture (2 vs 3: no tiller, 3-way merge considers also live state, Release Names are now scoped to the Namespace, cli commands renamed e.g. helm fetch -> helm pull) HELM_VERSION=3.2.0
3. eksctl or aws cli or aws management console?  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/eksctl-eks-cli/ "eksctl is now officially our command line for EKS"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html
4. eks pricing?  $0.10 per hour for each Amazon EKS cluster  https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/
When you use Amazon EKS control plane logging, you're charged standard Amazon EKS pricing for each cluster that you run. You are charged the standard CloudWatch Logs data ingestion and storage costs for any logs sent to CloudWatch Logs from your clusters. You are also charged for any AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon EBS volumes, that you provision as part of your cluster.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html
5. custom networking needed? not for eksctl, but possible
6. eksctl needs cloudformation?
7. eks HA - This control plane consists ofhttps://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/aws-eks/ at least two API server nodes and three etcd nodes that run across three Availability Zones within a Region.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html
8. eks - how to set k8s version?
```
+ eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yaml --version=1.16.8
Error: cannot use --version when --config-file/-f is set
```
then, we also cannot set patch version:
```
+ eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yaml
[ℹ]  eksctl version 0.19.0-rc.0
[ℹ]  using region eu-west-1
Error: invalid version, supported values: 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16
```
however:
```
metadata:
  name: cluster-eks
  region: eu-west-1
  version: "1.16"
```
in cluster.yaml works fine. The only information how to set it i found on: https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/issues/1984#issuecomment-608583084 (missing documentation on the whole cluster.yaml file)

* kops vs eksctl addons: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/operations/addons.md
networking how it works

* fargate for eks??


* is vpc and subnets auto created?
* is iam?
* how to setup ingress and LB? https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/load-balancing-and-ingress.html

t2.nano ami was ok for the default os (amazon linux 2) but is not ok for ubuntu: https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/aws-eks/amazon-eks-ubuntu-nodegroup.yaml
```

Error: unable to determine AMI to use: unable to determine AMI for region eu-west-1, version 1.16, instance type t2.nano and image family Ubuntu1804
```
we need at least t2.small and only the region US-WEST-2 or US-EAST-1 ? https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/optimized-support-amazon-eks-ubuntu-1804/ These commands confirm that there should be an ami for eu-west-1 too:
```
dojo@a7ba31d31b64(k8s-aws-dojo):/dojo/work/eks$ aws ec2 describe-images \

ami-0ceab0713d94f9276
```
but still:
```
Error: unable to determine AMI to use: unable to determine AMI for region eu-west-1, version 1.16, instance type t2.small and image family Ubuntu1804
```
This website however suggests that the ami is not available for k8s 1.16: https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/aws-eks/

\subsection{Other decisions and configuration}

\subsection{Expected cost}

* pricing? what resources does eks use? nat gateway? when? how?

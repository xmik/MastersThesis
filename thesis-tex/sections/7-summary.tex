\section{Summary}
\subsection{Lessons learned}

the greatest sources: AWS ESK www, eksctl, kops, all the gruntwork.io materials

\subsection{Future work potential}

eks with fargate
localstack for local experiments
test with production load - big ec2 instances or 100 of them

* tests - https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/node-conformance/
Compare more methods of deployment
Use more comparison criteria
Use more production requirements, e.g. automated upgrades
Apply more load and run load and performance tests
Instead of satisfying production requirements, test enterprise and big data deployments requirements - create a survey to get lessons learned based on long running clusters and their administration
Test available Kubernetes tools like Velero for backup

cost optimizing: use spot instances https://learnk8s.io/blog/kubernetes-spot-instances

more k8s namespaces - more environments
buy a domain, dns

compare some performance with already existing papers - (there was a paper that compared aws, gke, aks)

handling Stateful Data - volumes
